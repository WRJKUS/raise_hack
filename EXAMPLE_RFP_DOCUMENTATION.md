## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Complexity Analysis
**Use**: AI Platform RFP  
**Expected Results**:
- Lower timeline feasibility score due to complexity
- Recommendations for phased approach and risk mitigation
- Higher TCO considerations for AI infrastructure
- Detailed integration planning recommendations

### Scenario 2: Medium-Complexity Analysis
**Use**: Mobile App RFP  
**Expected Results**:
- Moderate scores across all dimensions
- Platform-specific development considerations
- Health data compliance recommendations
- App store and maintenance cost analysis

### Scenario 3: Migration Project Analysis
**Use**: E-Commerce RFP  
**Expected Results**:
- Timeline risks due to data migration complexity
- Legacy system integration challenges
- Performance optimization requirements
- Ongoing operational cost considerations

## How to Use These RFPs for Testing

### Step 1: Upload RFP Documents
1. Start the backend server: `python start_backend.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd leonardos-rfq-alchemy-main && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the "RFP Optimization" tab
4. Upload each PDF file using the upload interface

### Step 2: Run Analysis
1. Select an uploaded RFP document
2. Click "Start RFP Optimization Analysis"
3. Wait for the AI agent to complete the analysis
4. Review the results across all four dimensions

### Step 3: Compare Results
Analyze how the agent scores each RFP differently:

**Expected Score Patterns**:
- **AI Platform**: Lower timeline scores, higher cost complexity
- **Mobile App**: Balanced scores, moderate complexity
- **E-Commerce**: Timeline risks, migration challenges

### Step 4: Review Action Items
1. Navigate to the "Action Items" tab
2. Review immediate, short-term, and long-term recommendations
3. Test the checkbox functionality for marking items complete
4. Compare action items across different RFP types
